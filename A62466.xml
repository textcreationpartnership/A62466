         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But ſince by his death and this imployment. I may ſay (with <hi>Iob,</hi>) <hi>My Harp alſo is turned into

            <p>Where now you may behold a <hi>Sceleton,</hi> a glimpſe of that body, which (being alive) was the Cabinet of a religions ſoule, a deep under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a ſound judgement, a noble mind, a high &amp; commanding ſpirit. Hence he became wiſe in his deſigns, obedient in his principles, juſt in his actions, valiant in his reſolutions, and temporate in his whole life and converſation; which (being adorned with comlineſſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and behaviour, with affability of carriage and a courtly preſence,) made him a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Princes at their paſtimes, for Magiſtrates
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36742:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 125 -->at their Benches, for armed men at their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, for learned men at their books, for holy men at their prayers and devotions.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the vertues of a ſon, whoſe father dyed in his childhood.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the vertues of a child, brought up by his mother in her widowhood</p>
            <p>Theſe were the vertues of a young man, the only ſon, the only child of his Parents.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the vertues of one, who by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent worth and deſcent was a Champion.</p>
            <p>And theſe be the vertues of a Champion, who by his place &amp; title had no equall, no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, not one <hi>like him</hi> in the whole Kingdom: Nay, the hazard is too great, there will never be the like again.</p>
            <p>The ſubject was ſuch without all queſtion, the vertues may be queſtioned unleſſe they be further juſtified.</p>
            <p>And yet we may behold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bred (as it were) in the bone, nurſed up in the Cradle, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in his youth, ſuch as (no doubt) had brought forth abundance of fruit in due ſeaſon, had his ſtrength of body, and the command of his fortunes, been anſwerable to the courage
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36742:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 125 -->and magnificence of his ſpirit; Nay, all theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (though ſpringing like himſelf to a great height) were yet enlightned, not conſumed, by the flames of theſe times, theſe unhappy times made them more beautifull and exemplary, in that he was not carried away with every wind of doctrine, but upon mature deliberation, and conſultation too, ſetled in the ways of truth and ſoberneſſe, ſo that in the midſt of theſe diviſions &amp; diſtractions, I do not wonder to ſee him dye as he lived, not by the ſharpneſſe of the ſword, but ſubject to infirmity and ſickneſſe, a chriſtall veſſell ſoon broken by divine providence; Nay I conſider it (with others of like merit, veſſels of honour) taken away from the evill to come, as being fitter for the glory of a new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which is at unity in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Only (methinks) this rich Cabinet of fleſh and bloud wanted an exchange to ſet it forth, (I mean) an exchange of like nature &amp; quality, a conjugall ſociety, that ſo a living repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſelf might have commended it, from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>For my part I labour not to advance his worth, beyond the reach of envy: as being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36742:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 126 -->more vertuous then to eſcape it.</p>
            <p>Nor will I ſay, but amongſt ſo many Flowers of note, there might be now and then ſome ſpotted leaves, to obſcure a little the luſtre and brightneſſe of his proceedings; He may well die without a friend, who lives without a fault.</p>
            <p>Only I cannot ſay, God ſpeed the plough, <hi>which ploughed upon his back, and made long furrows,</hi> as though he alſo were earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and (there by) ſtood in need (like his land) to be tilled himſelf, and turned upſide down; whence perhaps it came to paſſe, that whilſt ſome thought him not ſo careles of his fortunes, as their craft could wiſh: others thought him not ſo open handed, as his condition, or their neceſsities required; and ſo the report ſtuck cloſe to him, (of ſticking cloſe to himſelf) a report which ſome others made too common by their credulity, thus tearing in peeces that reputation, which they could neither write nor read: But if we may judg by way of compariſon, &amp; every one ſet forth in their proper colours, the ploughers (no queſtion) had not then ſo much miſtook their ſoile, as (now I preſume) they did, for, <hi>ex melioriluto,</hi> experience found, he was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36742:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 126 -->not a greater Heir of land, then diſcretion how to uſe it, had he but lived to ſee (by the faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſervants) as much experience of the one, as of the other.</p>
            <p>The truth is, his predeceſſors freedom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards a heavy burthen upon his ſhoulders, which (together with other mens harms, and a wiſe example) made him ſeem a little <hi>partatueri,</hi> willing to know his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and by knowing to preſerve it, anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that wiſdom of <hi>Solomon, Be diligent to know the ſtate of thy Flocks:</hi> and might not this be well done for example ſake, the better to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf carefull, and to make others the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, for how can a man think to find his kindneſſe worthily accepted, or his friend ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently thankful, who knows not himſelf what he gives or grants?</p>
            <p>Sure I am this body wanted not (as many doe) a free and bountifull hand, when either the honour of his reputation, his love of learning, or his patronage required it. Inſtances of this nature might once have been drawn from the breath of our Noſtrils to the ſoles of his Feet, (being like that pretious oyntment, which from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36742:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 127 -->the top of <hi>Aarons</hi> head, ran down to the skirts of his clothing) but now the poore mans box, and the legacies which he gave his ſervants, are the beſt witneſſes, together with his care &amp; readines not to pull down but repaire Churches, this by name, as being the place deſigned by himſelf, for a more laſting monument of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors being, his own well-being, and devotion.</p>
            <p>Here (methinks) before I go hence, I could willingly call to your remembrance, the riches of his Library, the glory of his buildings, the orders of his family, and the proviſions of his houſe; were it not, that when the Qu. of <hi>Sheba</hi> came, and ſaw the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> and his building, <hi>the neat at his table, the ſitting of his ſervants, the attendants of his Miniſters and their apparrell,</hi> tis ſaid, <hi>there was no more ſpirit in her.</hi> So I fear a relation of this nature, though quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with all reſpects of civility and diſcretion, would make ſome ſpirits droop or raiſe up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beyond their due proportion.</p>
            <p>But let it ſuffice, time was when I might have told you <hi>in the day time,</hi> he had the favor of his Prince, the loyalty of a ſubject, the prayrs of the Church, and the decent buriall of a good
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36742:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 127 -->Chriſtian; buriall did I ſay? yes, that's paſt already: a burial not daubed with untempered morter, but ſolemnly performed according to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon like occaſion; from which form of divine ſervice, we now only borrow this eccho, <hi>Earth to Earth, Aſhes to Aſhes, Duſt to Duſt,</hi> and ſo we cover him with his own mould, the bowels of his Anceſtors, a noble and renowned family.</p>
            <p>Thus then in a word you may ſee and apply too, he who once was clothed in ſoft raiment, is now wrapped up in ſheets of lead, and he who was ſo frequently brought up in Kings houſes, and loved them too, is now <hi>ex congruo,</hi> lodged in one of Gods houſes, the bleſſing of a goodly heritage, his own patrimony; where we leave him with this memoriall, worthy to be written in letters of gold, <hi>He died Champion to the King and Crown of England, and now</hi> (like his title) <hi>lyes in the duſt expecting a ſpeedy and glorious Reſurrection,</hi> which that we may all obtaine, The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, and the Fellowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt be with us, and let all the People ſay, Amen.</p>
